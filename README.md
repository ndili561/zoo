Fantasy Zoo Manager

Goal: Practice OO modelling in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our bears, tigers, lions and other animals. The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, sell animals to other zoos. There should be at least two zoos, and at least three different animal species at each zoo, with different numbers of each species.

Additionally:

Animals can be fed so that they stay alive.
Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other.
Animals can breed to create baby animals.
Visitors can enter / exit the zoo if there are tickets left.
View the total income for the zoo.
Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures
